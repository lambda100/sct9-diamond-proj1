# SCT9 Team Diamond's Project 1

## About

The searching for tendering opportunities in GeBiz is done manually. The additional process of monitoring, tracking and consolidating the tendering opportunities are tedious and time-consuming. The constant manual monitoring / tracking coupled with the instability the GeBiz website added frustrations to the staff involved.

In the case of absence from the staff who does the role of monitoring / tracking of tenders, other staff who take over this role would need time to adapt / familiarize all the process involved. This further aggravated the challenges.

Stakeholders including Bidding Executive; Bidding Manager; Business Development Manager are affected such that their productive time is wasted in the above administrative work. The supposedly productive time could have been used efficiently to focus on preparing for winning bids. 

## Solution

Diamond Team uses **UiPath** to extract critical data in the tendering process via GeBiz website. The strategy is to automate a big bulk of the tendering database by utilizing tools in UiPath such as Data Scrapping and Orchestrator that deploy and manage handling of all the critical information, centralize logging, filing, monitoring and remote control replicating human interactions in tendering process.  This will **eliminate resources largely in terms of manpower, and time in extracting information** from GeBiz website. The resources saved can then be channeled for decision making and / for submission of tenders so that it minimizes missing of tender deadlines or potential tender opportunities.

The team used the **Design Thinking process** (Emphathise – Define – Ideate – Prototype – Test) and recorded this with the aid of Mural. Mural, being a platform that connects teams with a digital whiteboard and collaboration features designed to inspire innovation.
